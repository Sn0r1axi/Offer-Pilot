Through our liberal arts and sciences curriculum, you'll discover how to use your passions to build a bright future.\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n  * ####  Paying the admissions application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver?\nWe are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family and you plan on applying for financial aid, the fee will be waived. Please follow the steps below to request a fee waiver:\n**Common Application**\n    1. Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need and then select “Yes” to the prompt “You are eligible for application fee waivers if you meet one or more of the following criteria.\"\n    2. Complete the fee waiver signature. \n**Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir**\n    1. Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need listed in the Fee Waiver section of your Profile.\n    2. If you do not meet one of the indicators of economic need, you may enter the Harvard-specific fee waiver code on the payment page: JH3S5Q2LX9\n**Transfer Applicants**\n    1. Please see the [Transfer Application Requirements](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/transfer-applicants) for information about requesting a transfer application fee waiver.\n  * ####  What admissions criteria do you use?\nThere is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, their ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities.\n  * ####  Which standardized tests does Harvard require?\n**Harvard requires the SAT or ACT to meet its standardized testing requirement.** In exceptional cases, when those are not accessible for a student, one of the following can meet the requirement:\n    * AP exam results \n    * IB Actual or Predicted Scores\n    * GCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results\n    * National Leaving Exams Results (externally assessed) or Predictions\nExceptional cases typically involve a student facing challenges in paying for or accessing a test site or a student being unable to secure an available seat at a test site prior to the Regular Decision deadline. The Admissions Committee does not expect applicants to go to extraordinary measures to access SAT or ACT test sites. Applicants will have an opportunity to provide an explanation for why they are unable to submit the SAT or ACT.\nStudents who have other forms of testing listed above (AP, IB, GCSE, or National Leaving Exams) are still expected to take an SAT or ACT and submit those scores, if financial considerations or test availability would not limit their ability to do so.\nEnglish language proficiency examinations such as the TOEFL, IELTS and Duolingo **cannot be used** to meet the standardized testing requirement, though students are welcome to submit them for review as part of their application materials.   \n  \nStudents may self report their standardized test scores.   \n  \nIf the cost of taking the SAT or ACT is of concern, keep in mind that both the College Board and ACT provide fee waivers to some domestic students from low-income families. Students who are non-US citizens attending secondary schools outside the US are not typically eligible for SAT or ACT fee waivers. If applicants are ineligible for fee waivers, but still face financial hardship in paying for a SAT or ACT, the Admissions Committee still encourages these students to apply. We encourage students in this situation to take and submit results from other standardized tests to which they have greater access. For instance, students lacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP or GCSE results, IB/A-level/other national leaving exam predictions or results.\n  * ####  What is included in the Harvard supplement? \nThe supplement includes five required short-answer questions, each with a 150 word limit. We want to ensure that every student has the same opportunity to reflect on and share how their life experiences and academic and extracurricular activities shaped them, how they will engage with others at Harvard, and their aspirations for the future. Our continued focus is on considering the whole student in the admissions process and how they have interacted with the world.\n    1. Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a student body with a diversity of perspectives and experiences. How will the life experiences that shaped who you are today enable you to contribute to Harvard?\n    2. Describe a time when you strongly disagreed with someone about an idea or issue. How did you communicate or engage with this person? What did you learn from this experience?\n    3. Briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment experience, travel, or family responsibilities that have shaped who you are.\n    4. How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future?\n    5. Top 3 things your roommates might like to know about you.\n\n\n##  Apply \n###  How to Apply \nWe’ll guide you through the Common Application or Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, and answer any questions you have along the way. \n####  Quick Links \n  * [First-Year Applicants](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants)\n  * [Application Requirements](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/application-requirements)\n  * [Transfer Applicants](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/transfer-applicants)\n  * [International Applicants](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/international-applicants)\n  * [Visiting Undergraduate Students](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/visiting-undergraduate-students)\n  * [U.S. Military Veterans](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/us-military-veterans)\n\n\n###  Admissions Deadlines \n#### November 1 - Restrictive Early Action\nRestrictive Early Action applicants are notified by mid-December. \n#### January 1 - Regular Decision\nRegular Decision applicants will be notified by the end of March. \n[Learn About Applying Restrictive Early Action](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants#restrictive-early-action)\n##  Visit & Connect \n###  Visit & Connect \nFrom your own home, or while walking around Cambridge, there are lots of ways to explore our campus.

Visit our [QuestBridge site](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/questbridge) for more information about applying via the National College Match. \nFor the Common Application or Coalition Application, you will need to submit:\n  * Common Application or apply Coalition, Powered by Scoir.

Please note that standardized test scores (whether submitted directly via the testing agencies or self-reported in the application/applicant portal) are needed by the end of November for REA. \n  * Restrictive Early Action candidates apply by **November 1** and receive notification by **mid-December**.\n  * Regular Decision candidates apply by **January 1** and receive notification by the **end of March**.\n\n\nYou are welcome to apply to Harvard using the Common Application which opens August 1, or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, which opens August 15. \nHarvard is also a QuestBridge partner - please visit our [QuestBridge page](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/questbridge) for the applicable timeline.   \n  \n\n### First-year Timeline Questions\n  * ####  View detailed application timeline \n**_Spring or Summer (prior to the year you apply)_**  \nConsider taking the following tests:\nSAT or ACT - Harvard requires the submission of standardized testing\n**_Fall (of the year you apply)_**  \nAs early in the fall as possible, please submit:\n    * Your online application to Harvard, via the Common Application or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir. This is needed to open your admissions file, track your documents, and set up a possible alumni interview.\n    * The application fee or a [fee waiver request](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/register/?id=afdcbaf7-c10f-4610-9b31-1bfe6ad9eac2). You may send the application supplements at a later date, preferably no later than 2 weeks after the application deadline.\n**_October 31_**  \nRestrictive Early Action applicants: We request that you submit your required test scores by the end of October. However, you are still eligible to apply using the November series as they should reach us in time for consideration.\n**_November 1_**  \nRestrictive Early Action applicants: Your portions of the application are due by November 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary.\nAlso submit your financial aid application so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in mid-December when decisions are released.\n**_Early November_**  \nIf you are applying Regular Decision, we recommend that you submit standardized test scores from the November series or earlier, though you may submit December scores (SAT) or February scores (ACT).\n**_Mid-December_**  \nRestrictive Early Action applicants: Decisions released.\n**_January 1_**  \nYour portions of the application are due by January 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary.\n**_February 1_**  \nNotify the Admissions Office (fileroom@fas.harvard.edu) if you have not received your application confirmation email.\nSubmit your financial aid application (if still pending), so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in late March when decisions are released.\n**_Mid-February_**  \nRequest that your school submit your Midyear School Report forms with your most recent grades.\n**_End of March_**  \nFirst-year admission decisions released.\n**_Early May_**  \nReply deadline for admitted students.

Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College and have submitted self-reported ACT or SAT test scores will be required to submit official test scores at the time of enrollment.\nIf you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you may submit the November series if needed.\nFor Regular Decision, although it is possible to submit scores from tests taken as late as the February, we recommend that you submit testing as early as possible.\n\n\n![Harvard banner of Veritas shield](https://college.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/styles/billboard_image_medium/public/2024-03/56_0.jpg?h=a141e9ea&itok=mKHEHAmA)\n##  You can afford Harvard \nIn just a few minutes, you can get a personalized estimate of your Harvard scholarship with our Net Price Calculator. \n[Net Price Calculator](https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid/net-price-calculator)\n##  Restrictive Early Action \nApplying to Harvard under the Restrictive Early Action program empowers you to make a college choice early. Early applicants apply by November 1 and hear from us by mid-December. \nIf your record and accomplishments have been consistently strong over time, Restrictive Early Action may be an attractive choice. You don’t have to commit to coming to Harvard, but you will learn earlier if it is an option for you.\n### Consider if Restrictive Early Action is Right for You\n  * ####  What is Restrictive Early Action? \nHarvard welcomes interested applicants to apply under our Restrictive Early Action plan by November 1 in order to be notified of a decision in mid-December. Restrictive Early Action is a non-binding early program, signifying that if admitted, you are not obligated to attend, and have until May 1 to reply to our offer of admission. \n**IMPORTANT:**\n    * If you are applying to Harvard under Restrictive Early Action, you may not apply to any other private institution under an Early Decision, Early Action, or Restrictive Early Action plan, or to a binding early program at a public university.\n    * You are welcome to apply early to any public university, military academy, or university outside of the United States under a non-binding program. \n    * Additionally, you are able to apply to other universities under their Regular Decision or Early Decision II programs. \n    * If your application is deferred in the early action round, you may apply to a binding early decision program at another college (i.e. Early Decision II).\n    * You may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding. \n    * Harvard will meet the full financial need of admitted students regardless of whether they apply Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. \n  * ####  Is it easier to be accepted if I apply Restrictive Early Action? \nHarvard does not offer an advantage to students who apply early. While admit rates tend to be higher in Restrictive Early Action, this reflects the remarkable strength of the applicant pool rather than a benefit of application timing. For any individual student, the final decision likely would be comparable whether the student applies Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision.\n  * ####  What are the benefits of applying Regular Decision? \nRegular Decision offers important practical advantages.\n    1. You will have more time to edit and proofread your portions of the application, and more time for your teachers and counselors to become familiar with you before they write on your behalf.\n    2. Your application may be strengthened by senior year extracurricular achievements, course selections, academic performance, or other important factors.\n\n\n##  Mailing Your Application \nApplications that are received in the mail will be treated equally by the Admissions Committee. However, applications submitted online are processed faster and allow your school officials to submit their part of your application online as well. Please choose one option only: either apply online or send an application through the mail.*\n###### *All application materials sent become the property of the Office of Admissions & Financial Aid. We will not be able to return any application materials as a result.

Through our liberal arts and sciences curriculum, you'll discover how to use your passions to build a bright future.\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n  * ####  Paying the admissions application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver?\nWe are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family and you plan on applying for financial aid, the fee will be waived. Please follow the steps below to request a fee waiver:\n**Common Application**\n    1. Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need and then select “Yes” to the prompt “You are eligible for application fee waivers if you meet one or more of the following criteria.\"\n    2. Complete the fee waiver signature. \n**Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir**\n    1. Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need listed in the Fee Waiver section of your Profile.\n    2. If you do not meet one of the indicators of economic need, you may enter the Harvard-specific fee waiver code on the payment page: JH3S5Q2LX9\n**Transfer Applicants**\n    1. Please see the [Transfer Application Requirements](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/transfer-applicants) for information about requesting a transfer application fee waiver.\n  * ####  What admissions criteria do you use?\nThere is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, their ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities.\n  * ####  Which standardized tests does Harvard require?\n**Harvard requires the SAT or ACT to meet its standardized testing requirement.** In exceptional cases, when those are not accessible for a student, one of the following can meet the requirement:\n    * AP exam results \n    * IB Actual or Predicted Scores\n    * GCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results\n    * National Leaving Exams Results (externally assessed) or Predictions\nExceptional cases typically involve a student facing challenges in paying for or accessing a test site or a student being unable to secure an available seat at a test site prior to the Regular Decision deadline. The Admissions Committee does not expect applicants to go to extraordinary measures to access SAT or ACT test sites. Applicants will have an opportunity to provide an explanation for why they are unable to submit the SAT or ACT.\nStudents who have other forms of testing listed above (AP, IB, GCSE, or National Leaving Exams) are still expected to take an SAT or ACT and submit those scores, if financial considerations or test availability would not limit their ability to do so.\nEnglish language proficiency examinations such as the TOEFL, IELTS and Duolingo **cannot be used** to meet the standardized testing requirement, though students are welcome to submit them for review as part of their application materials.   \n  \nStudents may self report their standardized test scores.   \n  \nIf the cost of taking the SAT or ACT is of concern, keep in mind that both the College Board and ACT provide fee waivers to some domestic students from low-income families. Students who are non-US citizens attending secondary schools outside the US are not typically eligible for SAT or ACT fee waivers. If applicants are ineligible for fee waivers, but still face financial hardship in paying for a SAT or ACT, the Admissions Committee still encourages these students to apply. We encourage students in this situation to take and submit results from other standardized tests to which they have greater access. For instance, students lacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP or GCSE results, IB/A-level/other national leaving exam predictions or results.\n  * ####  What is included in the Harvard supplement? \nThe supplement includes five required short-answer questions, each with a 150 word limit. We want to ensure that every student has the same opportunity to reflect on and share how their life experiences and academic and extracurricular activities shaped them, how they will engage with others at Harvard, and their aspirations for the future. Our continued focus is on considering the whole student in the admissions process and how they have interacted with the world.\n    1. Harvard has long recognized the importance of enrolling a student body with a diversity of perspectives and experiences. How will the life experiences that shaped who you are today enable you to contribute to Harvard?\n    2. Describe a time when you strongly disagreed with someone about an idea or issue. How did you communicate or engage with this person? What did you learn from this experience?\n    3. Briefly describe any of your extracurricular activities, employment experience, travel, or family responsibilities that have shaped who you are.\n    4. How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future?\n    5. Top 3 things your roommates might like to know about you.\n\n\n##  Apply \n###  How to Apply \nWe’ll guide you through the Common Application or Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, and answer any questions you have along the way. \n####  Quick Links \n  * [First-Year Applicants](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants)\n  * [Application Requirements](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/application-requirements)\n  * [Transfer Applicants](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/transfer-applicants)\n  * [International Applicants](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/international-applicants)\n  * [Visiting Undergraduate Students](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/visiting-undergraduate-students)\n  * [U.S. Military Veterans](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/us-military-veterans)\n\n\n###  Admissions Deadlines \n#### November 1 - Restrictive Early Action\nRestrictive Early Action applicants are notified by mid-December. \n#### January 1 - Regular Decision\nRegular Decision applicants will be notified by the end of March. \n[Learn About Applying Restrictive Early Action](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants#restrictive-early-action)\n##  Visit & Connect \n###  Visit & Connect \nFrom your own home, or while walking around Cambridge, there are lots of ways to explore our campus.

This program is not for high school graduates who wish to study at Harvard for a gap year. Additionally, since the VUS Program is for full-time undergraduate students only, if you have already achieved the equivalent of a bachelor's degree, you would not be eligible. However, you might be eligible to be a \"Special Student\" at the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences. For more information on this program, please visit [their website](http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/programs_of_study/special_students_admissions.php).\n  * ####  Is there financial aid for visiting undergraduate students?\nAs a Visiting Undergraduate Student, you will not be eligible for Harvard financial aid and you must secure your own funding.\n  * ####  Are visiting undergraduate students eligible for Harvard housing?\nVisiting undergraduate students are typically not offered University housing. Accepted students must find their own housing before they arrive in Cambridge. Rarely, housing may be available, and admitted students will be notified about the process of obtaining campus housing.\n  * ####  Do Visiting Undergraduate Students (VUS) have the same privileges as Harvard Degree Candidates?\nWhile VUS are not degree candidates and do not receive a diploma from Harvard College, they have access to all libraries, academic, and athletic facilities just like Harvard degree candidates. VUS are affiliated with the Dudley Community, the Harvard Community for students who live off campus. If you would like to learn more about life as a Visiting Undergraduate Students and the affiliation with the Dudley Community visit: <https://dudley.harvard.edu/homepage>\n  * ####  May I apply for both Transfer Admission and for the Visiting Undergraduate Students Program at the same time? \nNo. Applicants may apply to only one program per admissions cycle.\n  * ####  Are enrolled VUS students allowed to apply to transfer? \nIf a VUS student is eligible, they are allowed to apply to transfer to Harvard. It is important to review [transfer eligibility requirements](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/transfer-applicants) to determine if you are eligible. Please note: all courses taken at Harvard College as a VUS will count toward your time at your home university.\n  * ####  When should I apply for the VUS program?\nFall Term or Full academic year\n    * Application opens: February 1\n    * Application deadline: April 1\nSpring Term \n    * Application opens: July 1\n    * Application deadline: September 1 \nIt is advised that you apply for the appropriate term. Additionally, we are not able to make early admission decisions for students who wish to apply for a later term.\n  * ####  Are Visiting Undergraduate Students (VUS) able to take graduate level courses? \nVisiting Undergraduate Students (VUS) are allowed to take courses at a graduate school but are limited to one per term. Courses which are not offered within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (the division which includes Harvard College and Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences) require additional cross-registration approval from your academic adviser to ensure students' courses fit into a liberal arts and sciences focus and remain centered around the undergraduate experience. \nVUS are not allowed to take classes at the Harvard Business School or Harvard Medical School.\n\n\n##  About the VUS Program \nAdd Harvard College to your undergraduate experience by spending a term or full academic year studying as a Visiting Undergraduate Student (VUS). We welcome the unique insights visiting students bring from their current universities around the world.\nIn addition to enrollment in courses at the college, you can take advantage of our many museums, laboratories, theaters, and extracurricular activities, all in the rich cultural and historical setting of Cambridge and Boston. \nYou should consider applying to the VUS program if you:\n  * Are currently enrolled in full-time, undergraduate study in the U.S. or abroad\n  * Have a strong academic and personal record at your current university\n  * Feel your interests would be well served by undergraduate courses which may not be offered normally in your home institution but are offered by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). View our [course catalog](https://courses.my.harvard.edu) for full listings.\n\n\nPlease note that visiting undergraduate students are not eligible for financial aid, so you will need to be prepared to cover all tuition and other costs.\n  * ####  What we look for in a VUS applicant \nYour Visiting Undergraduate Student application should demonstrate strong educational reasons for studying at Harvard College. Our committee considers:\n    * Evidence of academic strength and personal integrity\n    * Your academic preparation for your proposed plan of study\n    * Approval of your current college or university\n    * Breadth of interest both in and beyond the classroom\n    * Availability of space in the types of courses you wish to undertake\n    * A strong knowledge of the English language\nTypically, you will apply during your second or third year of undergraduate study. \n\n\n##  Application Timeline \nAdmission to the VUS program is offered twice per year. Students can apply to start in the fall or the spring term. Students applying for fall admission can enroll for either one semester or the full academic year. Applications must be submitted by the date of the deadline. Ordinarily, you are not allowed to defer admission, so please apply for the appropriate term.\n**Fall term or full academic year**\n  * Application opens: Mid-February\n  * Application deadline: April 1\n  * Notification of admission: by June 1\n\n\n**Spring Term**\n  * Application opens: July 1\n  * Application deadline: September 1\n  * Notification of admission: by November 1\n\n\n##  How To Apply \nThe application consists of information about the student, transcripts, and supporting documents from your current university, listed below. You will send out the forms requesting the various supporting documents through the online system once you have started the student portion of the application. For further information about each component of the application, please carefully read through the information below.\n### Detailed VUS Application Steps\n  * ####  Step 1: Submit the student portion of the Visiting Undergraduate Application. \nAs you fill out the [Visiting Undergraduate Student Application](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/apply/), you will need to:\n    * **Prepare a Tentative Course Plan:** This plan, considered part of your application, is an indication of the kinds of courses you would like to undertake at Harvard. It is not binding. Please consult our [course catalog](https://courses.my.harvard.edu/psp/courses/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=HU_CLASS_SEARCH) in preparing your plan, selecting courses in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Consider both the General Education section and departmental listings. With a few exceptions noted on the application, most courses are open to visiting students. Because some courses are limited in enrollment, require the instructor’s permission, or have prerequisites, adjustments to your course selection are to be expected during registration week. **Admission to our program does not guarantee your enrollment in any particular course.** Course schedules and information about limited enrollment for each academic year are typically available in late March. Many courses remain the same from year to year and any course not being offered is usually identified. However, if your course plan is dependent on a particular course, please contact the department to ensure it is being offered during the term for which you are applying and to determine the likelihood of being able to enroll in it. In addition, if you need a detailed course syllabus you will have to contact the department directly.\n    * **Write a brief Statement of Purpose.**\n    * **Submit an updated Resume or Curriculum Vitae.**\n    * **Submit your Application:** As soon as you submit your application you will gain access to the Applicant Portal where you can monitor the status of your application. Please check the portal regularly.\n**Our office cannot confirm receipt of supporting documents until your application has been submitted.**\n  * ####  Step 2: Submit two faculty recommendations. \nFaculty letters should come from your university professors or other university instructors/teachers who have taught you in the classroom.\n  * ####  Step 3: Submit a Dean’s Letter of Permission form \nThe Dean's Letter of Permission certifies that:\n    * You have the permission of your current university to study at Harvard\n    * You are in good academic and personal standing\n    * Upon satisfactory completion of the courses taken at Harvard, you will be granted degree credit\n  * ####  Step 4: Send an Official Secondary School Transcript \nIf you are from an international school system in which promotion is based upon standardized exams, you should also send a certified copy of your exam results. For example: British A levels, French Baccalaureate, Gaokao Results, International Baccalaureate, etc. Credentials must be in English or accompanied by a certified translation. Transcripts will be verified.\n  * ####  Step 5: Send an Official University Transcript \nCredentials must be in English or accompanied by a certified translation. You should submit a transcript from all universities you have attended. Transcripts will be verified.\n  * ####  Step 6: Submit a TOEFL or IELTS Score (for non-native English speakers only) \nStudents whose native language is not English **ARE REQUIRED** to submit a TOEFL or IELTS score not more than two years old. **Official tests results must be submitted directly to the Admissions Office from the testing services.** We will not accept any other language proficiency tests in lieu of the TOEFL or IELTS. \nWhile not required, candidates who have taken SAT or ACT tests are encouraged to submit their results, reported directly from the College Board (code #3434) or the American College Testing Service (code #1840).\n\n\n![Birds eye view of campus](https://college.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/styles/billboard_image_medium/public/2019-05/dsc_2509.jpg?itok=y7GlHqZv)\n##  Take a Virtual Tour \nUse our Virtual Tour to discover spaces that aren't even available on an in-person campus tour, such as classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, and more. \n[Explore Harvard](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/explore-harvard/virtual-tour)\n##  Cost of Attendance \nWhen you spend a term or year at Harvard, you will need to pay the [tuition and fees listed on this site](https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/tuition-and-fees). Visiting Undergraduate Students are not eligible for Harvard financial aid, and you must secure your own funding. In order to satisfy U.S. Immigration requirements, international students must demonstrate that they can afford all expenses, including tuition, fees, living expenses, and travel.\nWhile you are responsible for securing your own off-campus housing, you will need to show that you can afford the food and housing estimates shown below before arriving at Harvard.\nMost Harvard College students are enrolled in four courses (16 credits) per term, but you may choose to enroll in fewer. If you are an international student, you are required by United States immigration laws to enroll in a full-time program of study (a minimum of 3 courses) in order to obtain your visa.\n### **Cost of Attendance for 2025 - 2026**\n**Tuition ($7,415 per class)**\n**Cost** | **Per Semester** | **Per Year**  \n---|---|---  \n3 classes | $22,245 | $44,490  \n4 classes | $29,600 | $59,200  \n**Required Fees & Insurance**\n**Cost** | **Per Semester** | **Per Year**  \n---|---|---  \nVUS Student Services Fee | $919 | $1,838  \nHealth Services Fee* | $900 | $1,800  \nStudent Health Insurance** | $2,154 | $4,308  \n**Estimated Living Expenses**\n**Cost** | **Per Semester** | **Per Year**  \n---|---|---  \nHousing & Food | $11,100 | $22,200  \nPersonal | $1,750 | $3,500  \nTravel | $2,000 | $4,000  \n**Total VUS Costs**\n**Cost** | **Per Semester** | **Per Year**  \n---|---|---  \n3 classes | $41,068 | $82,136  \n4 classes | $48,423 | $96,846  \n[*Health Services Fee Information](https://hushp.harvard.edu/how-hushp-works/student-health-fee/)\n[**Student Health Program Information](https://hushp.harvard.edu/)\n##  Housing & Advising \nVisiting undergraduate students are typically not offered University housing and must find their own lodging before they arrive in Cambridge. If there are available campus housing spots, admitted students will be notified about the process to secure campus housing. \nSecuring an apartment in the Cambridge area can be competitive and time-consuming. It is important to allow sufficient time to find accommodation. It is critical to secure housing before arriving at Harvard.\n[Harvard University Housing](http://www.huhousing.harvard.edu/) cannot secure off-campus housing for undergraduate students, but they do provide a number of online resources and can answer questions that are common for students who will be new to Cambridge. (e.g., Which residential areas are close to the mass transit system? Which locations are within walking distance to Harvard Yard? What is a reasonable rental rate? etc.). After you have been accepted and decide to matriculate, you can access a Harvard University affiliate database of private market rentals and sublets.\n### Advising\nTo help ensure your time at Harvard is successful, we provide advising resources specifically for Visiting Undergraduate Students.\nOur advisers:\n  * Give you an extensive orientation upon arrival and approve your final course selection\n  * Meet with you by appointment throughout the term to discuss academic issues and monitor your progress\n  * Hold regular open office hours\n  * Help you access specialized advising resources\n  * Organize social gatherings with other visiting undergraduates\n\n\n##  Contact VUS Admissions \nIf you have any questions about the Visiting Undergraduate Students admissions, please contact us at adm-vus@fas.harvard.edu.
