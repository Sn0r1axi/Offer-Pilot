holding a conditional offer from the University of Cambridge for 2025 entry, check the guidance below for what will happen next.\n## Students holding conditional offers for 2025\n### If you meet or exceed all the conditions of your offer\nIn most cases you won’t need to do anything.\nWe will be made aware of your A level (or equivalent) results directly via UCAS, and your place will be confirmed. Your status will update on your UCAS Hub and you’ll soon receive an email with further details.\nIf we don’t receive your results directly via UCAS, then your Cambridge College should inform you where to send your results when they are received.\nPlease don’t call us for updates on your application. In the meantime, take a look at our [information for new students](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/after/new-undergraduate-students \"Information for new students\").\n### If you don’t quite meet the offer\nIn these circumstances, we'll need to know exactly how close you were to meeting your offer.\nWhere results are received directly via UCAS, they only provides us with your examination grades. Please send the relevant College details of your performance as soon as possible. This should be in the form of a scanned copy of your statement of results for each examination.\nThere may be a few spaces available at the College you applied to or at another College, depending on the number of students who have met their offers.\nPlease be patient. Your College will contact you as soon as possible and you can check the status of your application on your [UCAS Hub](http://www.ucas.com/track).\nPlease do not call the College or University for updates on your application. The Hub will be updated as soon as possible once a final decision is made.\n### If your grades are substantially lower than those required by your offer\nUnless there are special circumstances to consider, your application to Cambridge will have been unsuccessful. Hopefully, you’ll have made the grades for your insurance offer.\nYour status will be updated on your UCAS Hub so that you can take up your insurance place or enter Clearing. We don't enter Clearing, so there will be no course vacancies at the University through Clearing.\n### If you don't receive all of your results\nWe know that sometimes there are processing problems and your Cambridge College may already be aware that you’re missing a particular result.\nPlease [contact your Cambridge College](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/colleges/college-contacts \"College contacts\") as soon as you’ve received your missing results.\n## What to do if we have invited you to apply for reconsideration\nYou might be eligible to have your application reconsidered if we told you about our August Reconsideration Pool in your decision letter or email in January. Some places will be available for selected students on courses that have space for October 2025.\nFor further information, see [August Reconsideration Pool](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/after/apply-for-reconsideration \"Applying for reconsideration in August\").\n## No Clearing vacancies\nThe University of Cambridge does not enter Clearing. We have no course vacancies available through Clearing.\nFurther information about Clearing is available from the [UCAS website](http://www.ucas.com/).\n## Related links\n  * [Information for new students](http://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/applying/decisions/information-new-undergraduates)\n  * [UCAS - Sending exam results](https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/clearing-and-results-day/results-day/sending-exam-results)\n  * [August Reconsideration Pool](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/after/apply-for-reconsideration)\n\n\n### Cambridge Admissions Office\n  * Cambridge Admissions Office  \nStudent Services Centre  \nNew Museums Site  \nCambridge  \nCB2 3PT\n  * **Events** : caoevents@admin.cam.ac.uk\n  * **General admissions** : admissions@cam.ac.uk\n  * [College contacts](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/colleges/college-contacts)\n  * [Student chat](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/international-students/chat-our-students)\n\n\n### About this site\n[About our website](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/266)\n[Cookie notice](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/7502)\n[Privacy policy](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/7492)\n[Event participant data and booking policies](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/4612)\n[Contact us](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/267)\n### More information\n[Teachers and advisers](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/58)\n[Parents and supporters](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/parents)\n[International students](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/8)\n[Disabled students](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/125)\n[Mature students](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/395)\n[Care leavers and estranged students](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/128)\n[Freedom of Speech](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/19434)\n![University of Cambridge](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/themes/upstream/cambridge_theme/images/interface/main-logo-small.png)\n© 2026 University of Cambridge\n  * [Contact the University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/contact-the-university?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Accessibility](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-this-site/accessibility?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Freedom of information](https://www.information-compliance.admin.cam.ac.uk/foi?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Privacy policy and cookies](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-this-site/privacy-policy?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Statement on Modern Slavery](https://www.governanceandcompliance.admin.cam.ac.uk/governance-and-strategy/anti-slavery-and-anti-trafficking?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Terms and conditions](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-this-site/terms-and-conditions?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [University A-Z](https://www.cam.ac.uk/university-a-z?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n\n\n### [Study at Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/study-at-cambridge?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Undergraduate](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Postgraduate](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Professional and continuing education](https://www.pace.cam.ac.uk/?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Executive and professional education](https://www.epe.admin.cam.ac.uk/?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Courses in education](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n\n\n### [About the University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [How the University and Colleges work](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Give to Cambridge](https://www.philanthropy.cam.ac.uk/give-now?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Jobs](https://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk)\n  * [Map](https://map.cam.ac.uk/?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Visiting the University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/visiting-the-university?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n\n\n### [Research at Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Research news](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [About research at Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/research-at-cambridge?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Public engagement](https://www.cam.ac.uk/public-engagement?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Spotlight on...](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/spotlight-on?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n\n\n"

intervention for Pupil Premium students in local schools. It seeks to raise academic attainment, directly through GCSE Tutoring and indirectly through Oracy development, development of metacognitive skills and building academic confidence. The intervention runs from Year 8–Year 11, and takes place on visit days to the University, at partner schools, and online.\nThrough a series of engaging workshops students will be supported in the development of study skills that will help them with their GCSEs and beyond. They will have the opportunity to explore academic subjects that are not taught at school, in addition to finding out about different career possibilities.\nIn addition to raising the attainment of participants, Insight seeks to develop university self-efficacy and empower participants and their supporters to make informed decisions about future pathways. Students will receive timely advice and guidance to support in their decision making with regard to A-Level options and will be introduced to the university admissions process, if this is something they choose to move on to. Throughout the programme students will have the opportunity to interact with academics and student ambassadors studying at university.\nInsight works with students who attend selected schools in Cambridgeshire. If you are a school interested in taking part in the Insight programme see [Insight for Schools](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/insight-schools \"Insight for Schools\") for more information.\n## Selection criteria\nThe University of Cambridge is committed to widening participation to higher education. As part of this work, we would like to work with and support students who may have experienced either educational disadvantage or belong to a group that is statistically less likely to progress to higher education. On the Insight programme, we work with high prior attaining pupils from our partner schools who are eligible for pupil premium.\n## Contact Us\n![insight logo](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/files/insight_logo.png)\n**Insight Team**  \n**E** insightexplore@admin.cam.ac.uk\n### Cambridge Admissions Office\n  * Cambridge Admissions Office  \nStudent Services Centre  \nNew Museums Site  \nCambridge  \nCB2 3PT\n  * **Events** : caoevents@admin.cam.ac.uk\n  * **General admissions** : admissions@cam.ac.uk\n  * [College contacts](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/colleges/college-contacts)\n  * [Student chat](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/international-students/chat-our-students)\n\n\n### About this site\n[About our website](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/266)\n[Cookie notice](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/7502)\n[Privacy policy](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/7492)\n[Event participant data and booking policies](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/4612)\n[Contact us](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/267)\n### More information\n[Teachers and advisers](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/58)\n[Parents and supporters](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/parents)\n[International students](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/8)\n[Disabled students](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/125)\n[Mature students](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/395)\n[Care leavers and estranged students](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/128)\n[Freedom of Speech](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/node/19434)\n![University of Cambridge](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/themes/upstream/cambridge_theme/images/interface/main-logo-small.png)\n© 2026 University of Cambridge\n  * [Contact the University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/contact-the-university?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Accessibility](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-this-site/accessibility?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Freedom of information](https://www.information-compliance.admin.cam.ac.uk/foi?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Privacy policy and cookies](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-this-site/privacy-policy?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Statement on Modern Slavery](https://www.governanceandcompliance.admin.cam.ac.uk/governance-and-strategy/anti-slavery-and-anti-trafficking?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Terms and conditions](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-this-site/terms-and-conditions?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [University A-Z](https://www.cam.ac.uk/university-a-z?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n\n\n### [Study at Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/study-at-cambridge?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Undergraduate](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Postgraduate](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Professional and continuing education](https://www.pace.cam.ac.uk/?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Executive and professional education](https://www.epe.admin.cam.ac.uk/?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Courses in education](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n\n\n### [About the University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [How the University and Colleges work](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Give to Cambridge](https://www.philanthropy.cam.ac.uk/give-now?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Jobs](https://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk)\n  * [Map](https://map.cam.ac.uk/?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Visiting the University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/visiting-the-university?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n\n\n### [Research at Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Research news](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [About research at Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/research-at-cambridge?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Public engagement](https://www.cam.ac.uk/public-engagement?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n  * [Spotlight on...](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/spotlight-on?ucam-ref=global-footer)\n\n\n"
